_In this video, Prof. Steven Hall discusses how active learning recitations help him evaluate student learning one-on-one and as a group over multiple time scales. The format ensures everyone is engaged and working on the problem, providing insight into each student's understanding. This approach allows Prof. Hall to dynamically respond to the needs of both the class and individual students._
